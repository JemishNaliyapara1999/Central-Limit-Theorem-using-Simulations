# Central-Limit-Theorem-using-Simulations
• Developed a Python program-based simulation to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

• Simulation generates populations with random distributions. Then it creates multiple random samples from
the population.

• Simulation shows the sample mean converges to the population mean with an increase in sample size.

• It is helpful to understand the CLT. It is also useful to predict population means from a large sample.
